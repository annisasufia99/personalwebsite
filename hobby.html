<p>One of the things that I love to do during my leisure time is playing video games which is PUBG Mobile.  From my personal view, I can say that by playing video games it can release our daily stress even not for the long term but it do help. So, give it a try ! Trust me it won't dissapoint you guys. xoxo </p>

<p>My second hobby is watching movies! I often watched movies from netflix because there is a lot of newest movies in Netflix. So, whenever I free at night I would open up Netflix and watched the movies with my family.  Besides, I prefer Thriller type of movie because it is very fun to watch and not boring. Hehe</p>

<p>Last but not least, online shopping this is probably my self treatment huhuhu because I think that online shopping is really fun plus the price in online was more cheaper than the outside. Besides, I also found that online shopping is more convenience because customers can purchase items from the comfort of their own homes or work place. Shopping is made easier and convenient for the customer through internet. It is also easy to cancel the transactions.</p>
